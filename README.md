# This my home on the web
If I had the time, this is where I would blog. Generally I prefer writing code.

And here are some ideas of things I may one day blog about
- Don't get obsessed by frameworks
- Why travel photography might be an uneccessary evil
- Accessbility vs Best Practice, (form with no input fields *vs* get requests that modify)
